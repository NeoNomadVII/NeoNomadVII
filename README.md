- 👋 Hi, I’m @NeoNomadVII. I am french.

I worked as webmaster for 20 years. So my strong points are PHP/MySQL, HTML and CSS too off course. I love coding so I usually work with a top rated infographist who is a former collegue but mostly a friend and a great girl. Sometimes I think she was born in photoshop ;)<br/><br/>
I got my 1st computer at 7 (MO5, that doesn't make me feel younger :) ) and I made my first loops with turtle.<br/>
8 years later I had my win 3.1. I made a program in quick basic to draw maths function on my screen to help me with my maths homework. <i>What a nerd!</i><br/><br/>
My biggest project these past few years is to create my own CMS, almost finish, but I want always more, so I keep adding stuff. I certainly don't have the design of prestashop, but I am proud of my work so far.

- 👀 Recently, I am really ashamed of the lack of privacy and respect of our rights on the web to be anonymous. So I'm working on a full encrypted chat. And even me can't see who will be my users, or what they are talking about because I'll keep on my server the minimum datas required to have a functionnal chat, and even the datas stored on my DB will be crypted.<br/>
Maybe after that, I will work on something more fun, like a game. I know that pretty soon, we will have more and more VR games. The prices start to get lower. Though I think it's time to work on this.
<br/>
- 🌱 And to do apps, I'm currently revisiting my java skills, and looking at Kotlin.<br/>
- 💞️  Maybe I could use some help for the iOS part (not my cup of tea) xD
